## Tips & Tricks

### For Beginners
- **Start at 0.5x speed** to place notes accurately
- **Pause often** - no rush!
- **Test as you go** - export and try it in the game
- **Keep it simple** - 1 note per beat is fine for Easy difficulty

### For Better Accuracy
- **Use the visual timeline** - notes scroll up from the bottom
- **Listen for the beat** - place notes on strong beats
- **Check the sidebar** - shows all your notes with timestamps
- **Delete mistakes** - click the ✖ button next to any note

### Workflow
1. **First pass** (0.5x speed): Place all tap notes on main beats
2. **Second pass** (0.75x speed): Add hold notes
3. **Third pass** (1x speed): Fine-tune and test
4. **Export** and test in the actual game
5. **Refine** based on gameplay

## Keyboard Shortcuts

   - **💾 Download File** - saves as map.json automatically

## Common Issues

**Notes feel off-time in the game?**
- Some browsers have audio latency
- Try adding/subtracting 50-100ms from all note times

**Can't place notes accurately?**
- Slow down playback speed
- Use pause and play, placing notes while paused

**Hold notes not working?**
- Make sure "Hold Note" mode is selected
- Hold must be at least 200ms (0.2 seconds)
- Try clicking and dragging more deliberately

**Want to start over?**
- Click **🗑️ Clear All** to delete all notes
- Or delete notes one by one from the sidebar

## Example Workflow

Let's create a simple 8-beat pattern:

1. Set playback to **0.5x speed**
2. Click **▶ Play**
3. Click **Lane 1** on beat 1
4. Click **Lane 2** on beat 2
5. Click **Lane 3** on beat 3
6. Click **Lane 4** on beat 4
7. Repeat for beats 5-8
8. **Export** and test!

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable:
- Try more complex patterns
- Add hold notes for sustained sounds
- Vary lanes to make it more interesting
- Increase difficulty with faster notes
- Test with friends and get feedback!

Happy mapping! 🌸✨
